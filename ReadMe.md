Problem Definition:
We are given m sequences of data nodes. Sequence may have different numbers of data nodes. The problem is to align m sequences such that data nodes with similar nodes are aligned in the same column to get higher score. 
For example, given 5 sequences of data nodes (a), the idea output for data alignment will be (b). 

The program cannot be run if the directory is not set to the corresponding directory.
The .py file should stay along with the folders "SegDataOO" to work properly.
